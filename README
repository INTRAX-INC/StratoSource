Install from the yum repo (serenity.usersys.redhat.com/yum)

Create your MySQL database.  If you want to keep the configuration simple, use the names
already defined in settings.py.  Therefore, call the database "collabsrc" and the owning
MySQL user "collabsrc" with password "redhat".

Note: If you want to customize the names you have to edit settings.py as well.

Finally, run:
python manage.py syncdb

This will create all tables and indexes.  You will be prompted to create an admin user and password.
This is necessary to give you access to the admin pages for setting up repos.

Django and CollabSrc should now be available on port 80.  If not, make sure Apache is running and consult
the httpd error log for more.

Log into the CollabSrc admin pages with: http://yoururl/admin using the admin user/password you created
during the syncdb step.  From here create repos and branches as needed.  Once done, you are ready to
use CollabSrc.
